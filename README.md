# ChatApp

An iOS realtime chat application I built as code practice. The project was created following LBTA's Firebase tutorial and then refined using the MVVM+C pattern.

This application was mainly done as an intro to Firebase, a practice for creating views without storyboards/nibs and for learning the MVVM+C pattern. Also, the goal was to use as little frameworks as possible, but I may add some in the future if I see fit to learn some.

**TODO**


The core of the application is done, but I may add additional improvements, such as Firebase database simplifications/optimizations, textfield validators etc.
